== INSTALLATION

1) Enable gems from github, if you haven't already done so (rubygems >= 1.2): 
    > sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

2) Install gem
    > sudo gem install Floppy-currentcost

== REQUIREMENTS

Floppy-rb232 >= 0.2.3

== USAGE

You can read data from the meter by creating an instance of the CurrentCost::Meter
class, and registering an observer which will receive readings. See examples/simple.rb
or the CurrentCost::Meter documentation for a simple example of how to do this.

== TRAY MONITOR

This gem includes the 'currentcost_tray_monitor.rb' application. This is a program
which will sit in your system tray and display a coloured icon based on your power
usage. To use the program, run:

  currentcost_tray_monitor.rb -p your_serial_port_name

The program requires the Gtk2 libraries for Ruby (available from
http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/). If the EEML gem (http://github.com/Floppy/eeml-ruby)
is installed, it can also serve your power data over an HTTP connection to a system like
Pachube (http://www.pachube.com).
